These are device cleanup scripts that I have created to optimise and restore the maximum performance of Windows 10/ Windows 11 PCs with minimal intervention.

There are two different scripts, the "User-Optimiser" will remove old temporary files and junk that is associated with the user account that has initialised the script, the "System_Optimiser" will remove any system files and junk whilst keeping the user data intact.

I recommend that you run both scripts for maximum effectiveness in restoring the performance and smooth operation of your computer system, I recommend that you run the "System_Optimiser" first.

When downloading the file you may be asked are you sure you want to keep the file, to do this:

Click on the 3 dots next to the file
Click on "Keep".
Click on "Show More".
Click on "Keep Anyway".


I take no legal responsibility for the outcomes that occur as a result of running the script.
