Visit Hackboto Tech Tips for the latest versions of Computer and Settings optimiser scripts
https://hackbototechtips.github.io/download_centre.html





I have created 4 different optimisation scripts that you can run on your Windows 10/ 11 computers to improve the performance, stability, reliability, efficiency, and to reduce the amount of adware and telemetry.

The following is a breakdown of the different scripts so that you understand what they do and what they are suitable for, they are in the order that I recommend you run them:

System_Optimiser: This will optimise your operating system, this will run integrity scans, fix corruption, remove temporary files, this will improve the overall performance and efficiency of your computer.

User_Optimiser: This will optimise your user account, this will remove any junk/ temporary files you have acuminated, this will improve things like app opening times and login times as well as freeing up space on your computer.

System_Settings_Optimiser: This will change your system settings to reduce telemetry, improve privacy, reduce bloatware such as AI features, this will make your computer run smoother and better to use, however many of these changes will only apply to the administrator account.

User_Settings_Optimiser: This performs many of the same changes as the System_Settings_Optimiser, however it will only impact the account that executes the script.

When downloading the scripts, you may be asked are you sure you want to keep the file, to do this:
Click on the 3 dots next to the file
Click on "Keep".
Click on "Show More".
Click on "Keep Anyway".

Please be aware that I take no legal responsibility for any file losses or unwanted modifications to your computer system, although this is unlikely, I am required to outline that I take no legal responsibility.
